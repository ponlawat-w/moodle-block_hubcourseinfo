# Hub Course Info Block
*moodle-block_hubcourseinfo*

The Hub Course Info Block plugin is a part of a suite of three plugins designed to replace the core Moodle Hub code. Since Moodle 3.3, the ‘Publish’ function inside courses has been removed and the previous MoodleNet Hub will be replaced by a new MoodleNet strategy that is under construction. Associations and organizations can use these three new contributed plugins to share courses without having to change Moodle core.

The purpose of this Hub Course Info Block plugin is to contain course metadata in hub way, and to manipulate interactions of courses in hub of both course author (uploader) and visitors. Therefore, this plugin is a core plugin of hub functionality in the hub suit of three plugins. Even though the plugin has no dependencies, it works better in Moodle hub site with the upload block also installed ([moodle-block_hubcourseupload](https://github.com/ponlawat-w/moodle-block_hubcourseupload)).

This plugin is a block type and there will be only one instance of the block in a course. The content in the block displays course metadata, reviews and versions information of hub course. It also allows course uploader to edit metadata, manage versions and view reviews. In addition, course visitors can write reviews, give ‘likes’ to the course, and download an mbz backup file of the current course.

Information for this plugin is available from Don Hinkelman ([hinkelman(at)mac.com](mailto:hinkelman@mac.com)) and programming support is by Ponlawat Weerapanpisit ([ponlawat_w(at)cmu.ac.th](mailto:ponlawat_w@cmu.ac.th)).
